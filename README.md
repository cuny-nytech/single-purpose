# Gabriela Voll's Single-Purpose Site

This single-purpose app, tell you whether or not it is party time. It is indeed party time after 5pm and before 9am. from 9am-5pm it is not party time. 

little confused about the instructions, but: 
you just download the files
run install bundler ( to utilize the versions of sinatra and ruby specified)
heroku create
git push heroku master
heroku open 
and the website should be up at whatever randomly generated website they give you
