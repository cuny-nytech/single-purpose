The Single Purpose Website that I created is to show the countdown of Sonic Boom Shattered Crystal for the 3DS.
This game is next to come out next month. This app does three things:

1: Displays the countdown.
2: Displays some snapshots of the game.
3: Plays a nice track in the background while viewing the page.

Unfortunately I had no luck getting this deployed on Heroku. 
In any case I will be happy to show you guys how this app works tomorrow during our session.

Take care!
