This is a simple application using the sinatra gem. The main purpose to display the current weather. Depending the weather it will display a certain image. A sun with a smiley face when it is sunny and vice versa. When one clicks on the image, it goes to theweatherchannel.com and shows the five day weather forecast (New York, New York). In order to achieve this, I also used a weather gem. 

gem install weather-api

There are several bugs at the moment. It is not correctly displaying text such as the temperature and the date.

Unforunately, it is not working.
