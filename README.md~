# Single-Purpose Site

This is Mirna Single-Purpose Site. It tells you whether it is weekend yet or not. If not, it shows the time left for the weekend.

Unfortunately though, I deployed to heroku, but it gives me Application error when I click the link to it.

Application Error

An error occurred in the application and your page could not be served. Please try again in a few moments.

If you are the application owner, check your logs for details.

Any help?
